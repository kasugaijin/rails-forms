This is the Forms project from the Ruby on Rails path of The Odin Project. This was good practice for creating a Rails app and configuring it for basic User creation and editing using forms, including:
-  Creating a User model with a username, password and email that a validated for 'presence'
-  Configuring the routes for User for #new, #create, #edit, #update
-  Creatig a User controller with methods for new, create, edit and upate and a private method to pass in a validated hash into User.new before committing to the Users table
-  Creating views for new and edit with forms. The forms were constructed using HTML, form_with and tags, and form_with an object. This was good practice in understanding how forms are constructed and what the attributes are doing e.g., URL, method, and name.
